# Krita Plugin for the Leonardo.Ai

[Leonardo.AI](https://leonardo.ai) is an awesome Service for generating and manipulating 
Images with AI. They provide an own Web-Application for generating and manipulating images
with AI. However, their Web-Application is not (yet) a full-featured painting tool!

Therefore, I decided to develop a plugin which connects the power of Leonardo.AI with the
open source and powerful painting application [Kirta](https://krita.org)

# Setup
## Linux

```shell
cd ~/.local/share/krita/pykrita
git clone https://github.com/rainu/krita-leonardo-ai.git leonardo_ai
```

# Settings

At this moment there is no Settings available and can not be used by experienced users yet! 
This Plugin is Pre-Pre-Alpha!
